    """
    Compute the k-nearest neighbors graph in a privacy-preserving manner using Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC).

    This function calculates the Euclidean distance between all pairs of input samples,
    finds the k-nearest neighbors for each sample, and returns a matrix where non-nearest
    neighbor distances are set to zero.

    Args:
        X: A (num_samples, num_features) matrix containing the input samples.
        num_samples: Total number of samples in X.
        num_features: Number of features in each sample.
        n_neighbors: The number of nearest neighbors to retain for each sample, excluding the sample itself.
        mode: Specifies the output format (default: "distance").
        metric: The distance metric used (default: "minkowski").
        p: The order of the Minkowski distance (default: 2 for Euclidean distance).

    Returns:
        Knn3: A (num_samples, num_samples) matrix where each row contains the distances
              to its k-nearest neighbors, with all other entries set to zero.
